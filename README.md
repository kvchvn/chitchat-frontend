## Chit-chat

---

Simple chat is being made within `WebSocket`.  
The app is a training project and it's in progress since 20 August 2023.  

There is the front-end part in the repo. You can find the back-end [here](https://github.com/kvchvn/chitchat-backend).

See instructions below __to run the app__ locally:  

- `git clone https://github.com/kvchvn/chitchat-frontend.git` - clone the repo on your PC;
- `cd app` - move to /app directory.
- `pnpm install` - install dependencies (P.S. be sure you have installed `node.js (lts-version)` with `npm` and `pnpm` globally);
- `pnpm run dev` - run the app (P.S. you must create and fill `.env` file inside the /app, see `.env.example` as an example).
- use the app :)
